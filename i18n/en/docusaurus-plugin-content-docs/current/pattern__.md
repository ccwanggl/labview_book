# Common Patterns

![](../../../../docs/cover/pattern.png)

The earlier chapters provided a foundational understanding of LabVIEW, equipping you with the skills needed to create simple programs. As we progress into this chapter and beyond, the focus shifts to developing larger-scale programs. Despite the diversity in the form and function of extensive LabVIEW applications, they often share common structural themes and patterns. These patterns typically involve strategic combinations of functions, structures, or sub-VIs. Gaining proficiency in these prevalent programming models is a crucial step towards effectively writing and analyzing more complex and sizable LabVIEW programs.
